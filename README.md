## Customization

### Adding New Attack Types
Modify the `attackTypesData` array in `page.js` to include new attack vectors.

### Updating Color Schemes
Modify the color functions (`getSeverityColor`, `getProtocolColor`, `getStatusColor`) to change the color coding.

### Adding New Metrics
Extend the metrics cards section to include additional KPIs relevant to your monitoring needs.

## Deployment
